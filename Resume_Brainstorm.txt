T-Mobile:
	- In-depth analysis and solutioning for several thousand customer locations for major federal agencies
		- Crafted reports detailining 5G connectivity metrics, qualified solution feasibility, addressed weak/pain points in customer locations, produced customer-friendly visuals and explanations.
		- I did this for major agencies on a frequent basis. This work was imperative to securing long-standing relationship and government contracts worth millions of dollars.
		- Utilized both internally and externally to drive success, allowing sales and engineering to target high-priority locations with the highest ROI possible.
	- Customer-facing consultation, both pre-sales and post-sales, to address connectivity, network, infrastructure, and device pain points
		- Spot-checked 100s of locations with urgency to guarantee customer satisfaction
		- Fire drills to assist in analyzing and collecting metrics based on emergency pain points for customers (Outages, 3G/4G LTE migrations)
	- Constructed and presented customer facing demonstrations that outlined T-Mobile's connectivity solutions within the context of their unique environments.
		- Maps, metrics, upgrade/improvement timelines, potential roadblocks and workarounds, and the implication/signifcance of all of that.
		- Crucial for responding to RFP/RFQ/RFI requirements with compliance

		- Worked with Legal Affairs, Bid Managers, Specialist Engineers, and Sales to produce the most optimal and compliant technical response to Government RFPs/RFQs
	- Led a technical project for Public Sector Solutions Engineering that produced a RFP Intelligence Platform that reduced manual analysis and response generation by 20 hours per week per stakeholder
		- Provided Director and Executive level insights into Enterprise and Government opportunities based on predicted ROI, complexity, and solution feasibility.
		- Intelligence system leveraged LLMs and Gen AI to process, parse, and analyze exstensive RFP documents.
		- Managed stakeholder expectations and feedback from multiple internal organizations
		- Primary liasion of the Sales, Solutions, Customer Success, and Bid Management organizations to IT (AI Automation Engineers).
		- I came up with the whole thing start to finish.
		- Acted as a lead project manager representing the Director of Public Sector SE and VP of SE at T-Mobile.
		- One of my greatest accomplishments while at T-Mobile
	- Direct contributor to T-Mobile's only Federal Government Solutions Engineering
		- #1 Performing SE Team out of all of Solutions Engineering at T-Mobile in 2025 with 500%+ revenue attainment 
		- Assisted team in vastly exceeding revenue attainment quotas by 145%, 152%, and 500% (Verify this value) with significant growth across the last 3 years
		- Team vastly outperformed expectations and established financial goals
		- I directly contributed to a majority of the deals our team secured with the Federal Government, some individual deals netting millions of dollars over several years of partnership with the Federal Government
	- Utilized Gen AI, LLMs (GPT-5), and localized scripting to automate data collection and the generation of customer facing technical reports and solution demonstrations, saving the team 10+ hours of weekly prep work so that they could spend more time in front of customers.
		- Created a script using the JavaScript library Puppeteer with Python's Pandas to automate the manual capture of topographical coverage maps in bulk to decrease response times to customer queries to hours instead of days.


Samsung:
	- Specialized in creating and facilitating live technical demonstrations of comprehensive mobility solutions for enterprise and SMB customers.
		- Included all aspects of the technical stack, custom tailored to the customer's environment, such as SaaS, connectivit solutions, and devices.
		- Visited customer locations to fully understand their current configurations and the pain points that they wanted to address.
	- Provided exstensive emergency post-sales support to a major Enteprise customer, Coca-Cola, which resulted in optimizing the customer's expenses and retaining their business with Samsung.
		- One of the major bottling subsidiaries within Coca-Cola was facing immense data overages by over $30,000 on their monthly bills with our partnered wireless provider. 
		- I arranged a meeting between Samsung's and our carrier's technical support and the C-Level of this bottler and their IT operations leadership.
		- Established a daily cadence with the customer's IT operations to ensure that they were fully informed by our efforts.
		- Faciliated widespread device data collection leveraging Samsung's mobile device management SaaS solutions to isolate the root cause of the exorbant data usage, which ended up being the Google Play Store repeatedly updating the same apps over and over.
		- Recruited a technical support team at Google to assist with addressing the issue.
		- Led to the discovery of an never before identified bug in Google's rollout of a specific software version on their app store.
		- Performed a gradual rollout of Google's patched software to the customer's devices until the issue was fully resolved and data usage was returned to normal levels.
