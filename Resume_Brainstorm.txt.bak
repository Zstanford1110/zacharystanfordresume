T-Mobile:
	- In-depth analysis and solutioning for several thousand customer locations for major federal agencies
		- Crafted reports detailining 5G connectivity metrics, qualified solution feasibility, addressed weak/pain points in customer locations, produced customer-friendly visuals and explanations.
		- I did this for major agencies on a frequent basis. This work was imperative to securing long-standing relationship and government contracts worth millions of dollars.
		- Utilized both internally and externally to drive success, allowing sales and engineering to target high-priority locations with the highest ROI possible.
	- Customer-facing consultation, both pre-sales and post-sales, to address connectivity, network, infrastructure, and device pain points
		- Spot-checked 100s of locations with urgency to guarantee customer satisfaction
		- Fire drills to assist in analyzing and collecting metrics based on emergency pain points for customers (Outages, 3G/4G LTE migrations)
	- Constructed and presented customer facing demonstrations that outlined T-Mobile's connectivity solutions within the context of their unique environments.
		- Maps, metrics, upgrade/improvement timelines, potential roadblocks and workarounds, and the implication/signifcance of all of that.
		- Crucial for responding to RFP/RFQ/RFI requirements with compliance
	- Ensured compliance with Federal Government regulations and requirements from a Solutions Engineering perspective
		- Worked with Legal Affairs, Bid Managers, Specialist Engineers, and Sales to produce the most optimal and compliant technical response to Government RFPs/RFQs
	- Led a technical project for Public Sector Solutions Engineering that produced a RFP Intelligence Platform that reduced manual analysis and response generation by 20 hours per week per stakeholder
		- Provided Director and Executive level insights into Government opportunities based on predicted ROI, complexity, and solution feasibility.
		- I came up with the whole thing start to finish, doesn't matter if it ever worked or finished. In a smaller company where I had more control, it would have been done successfully. Talk a lot about this.
